Our readers must not necessarily be triggered to actively engage more in societal matters (however, please do), instead we are inviting you to broaden your perspective. That is how we create change. By noticing individuals, interpreting, exploring, reading and thereby also boozing yourself with more ideas than you already knew about. That is basically the spirit wherein TORT was born.",

"My name is Lizette Olofsson and I am the editor-in-chief of TORT. As a fifteen year old, I left my home and the conservative village where I was raised. I saw myself as some pre-version of Beyonce in Lemonade. So far I had lit no fires, until I created TORT – this is the first project giving me burning flames. Started and created out of passion together with some of the most inspiring people I know. Hopefully, you will be able to read more about that feeling in our first issue, published in May. Best, Lizette",
