                    Do we need tort magazine? Obviously no, I mean, what do we really need? But let’s skip that discussion. In many ways we actually need a magazine like tort. Not only due to my ego or reasons projected by the same. However, tort portrays engagement, movements and reformations in the society. Our platform aims to point out voices, which, directly or indirectly, can be heard in the discussions about societal issues. And let’s be clear about one thing – we all need to level up. Not to be interpreted that it’s sophisticated to join the trendy Swedish lifestyle (that is; you just do whatever a “healthy” influencer does, without any reflections). No. Instead, we are inviting our readers to broaden their perspective. Our readers must not necessarily be triggered to actively engage more in societal matters (however, please do). It’s quite more simple, like, let people finish their sentences. Talk to people who you haven’t yet talked to, and listen. That is basically the spirit wherein TORT was born.
                    
                    My name is Lizette Olofsson and I am the editor-in-chief of tort. I’ve always (!) wanted to work for a magazine, but due to a lack of courage, I went to law school. Today I work with legal tech, I know everything about Elon Musk and I spend hours reading documents from the European Commission. But that’s not everything. I’m also someone who is questioning stuff (my life) and get shit done (tort). Together with some of the most inspiring people I know, TORT was born – 100 % out of passion. That feeling will be manifested in our first issue, coming in May 2020.</p><br>
                    <!--  Do we need TORT? Obviously no, I mean, what do you really need? But let’s skip that discussion. In many ways we actually need a magazine like tort. Not only due to my ego or reasons projected by the same, but engagement and movements in the society are needed, and various reformations must be illuminated. tort is in that matter a platform aiming to point out voices that, directly or indirectly, can be heard in the discussions about societal issues. The idea behind TORT was created after a lunch with my mentor (yes, having a mentor is part of my survival strategy). She asked me, her eyes firmly staring into mine, why I was not publishing any of my texts. At first, I thought she was being provocative; was she trying to tell me I was a sloppy legal professional, and that I should change into something else but law? Maybe she was. However, lately, I rather believe she intended to encourage me to level up. Something that permeates the entire production of tort and the message to you – level up! The rest of the team responded on my initial suggestions for articles with “level up”. My thoughts that tort was portraying some kind of bonus pater families – level up. My thoughts about sticking to safe topics, my thoughts about sticking to one or two groups of individuals, my thoughts about sticking to subjects related to ongoing movements in Sweden – level up! 
                        Our readers must not necessarily be triggered to actively engage more in societal matters (however, please do), instead we are inviting you to broaden your perspective. That is how we create change. By noticing individuals, interpreting, exploring, reading and thereby also boozing yourself with more ideas than you already knew about. That is basically the spirit wherein tort was born. 
                        My name is Lizette Olofsson and I am the editor-in-chief of tort. On my own, I moved away from home and left the tiny village I was raised within when I was fifteen years old. In the same moment as I rolled out of the small community, filled with determination, I saw myself as some pre-version of Beyonce in <a href="#" data-tool-tip="Lemonade was her sixth studio album, bla bla bla,">Lemonade</a>. However, so far I have lit no fires, and my forces have only been undefinable vague notions. Until I created TORT – this is the first project giving me burning flames. Started and created out of passion together with some of the most inspiring people I know. Hopefully, you will be able to read more about that feeling in our first issue, published in May. -->
